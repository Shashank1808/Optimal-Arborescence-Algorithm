# Optimal-Arborescence-Algorithm
Fiding optimal aborescence for a directed graph using Chu-Liu-Edmond's algorithm.
This is a project for undergraduate course **CS302- Analysis and Design of Algorithms**, under Dr. Apurva Mudgal at IIT Ropar.

## Things to do:
1. ~~add edge-weight (and other) checks to main~~
2. ~~precomputation functions:~~
    - ~~remove_edges~~
    - ~~choose_best_parallel_edge~~
3. find_min_arbrorescence function
4. ~~create_f_star function~~
5. ~~check_cycle function~~
6. compress_graph function
7. decompress_arborescence function
